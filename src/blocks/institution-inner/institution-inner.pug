//            p Computer Systems Institute (CSI) is a dynamic institution providing career-focused high-quality programs designed to enhance job opportunities for our graduates and provide a skilled workforce for the community. We strive to achieve this by employing qualified and enthusiastic professionals who create a stimulating learning environment and deliver effective career development services.

CSI offers a diverse range of courses, including business, hospitality, customer service, computer science, and healthcare. CSI has six campuses across Illinois and Massachusetts (Allston, Charlestown, Worcester, Chicago, Lombard, and Skokie).

CSIâ€™s focus on helping students gain the academic skills, knowledge, and support they need to reach their personal and professional goals is stronger than ever.
